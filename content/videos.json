Yes, you read that right. Could Bitcoin become America’s digital gold?\n\nThis bold idea stems from Senator Cynthia Lummis' *Bitcoin Act of 2024*, proposing the U.S. government acquire 200,000 Bitcoin annually a total of 1 million over five years. Instead of taking on new debt, assets like seized Bitcoin, Federal Reserve bonds, and even gold reserves could be reallocated to fund the plan. Because nothing says fiscal innovation like swapping gold bars for digital coins.\n\nTrump’s crypto pivot, from launching NFTs to his son's involvement in DeFi signals his growing embrace of digital assets. This isn't about Bitcoin’s price skyrocketing; it’s a move to position the U.S. as a leader in the digital economy. But the hurdles are real: Congressional debates, traditionalist opposition, and Bitcoin's notorious volatility loom large.\n\nMeanwhile, other nations are already ahead. El Salvador and Bhutan hold Bitcoin, and rumors swirl about a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund making allocations. The Biden administration is rushing to sell over $6.5 billion worth of Silk Road Bitcoin before Trump potentially reclaims office.\n\nWhat do you think?
