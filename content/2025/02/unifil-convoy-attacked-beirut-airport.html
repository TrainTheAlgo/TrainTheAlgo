<h2>A Shocking Attack on Peacekeepers</h2>
<p>On February 14, 2025, a convoy carrying United Nations peacekeepers was violently attacked near Beirut's international airport. One of the vehicles was set on fire, and the outgoing deputy force commander of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was injured. The attack has sparked outrage, with UNIFIL demanding an immediate and full investigation.</p>

<h2>What Led to the Attack?</h2>
<p>The assault appears to be linked to growing tensions in Lebanon. Earlier that day, Lebanese authorities revoked permission for an Iranian passenger plane to land in Beirut, a decision that triggered protests. Reports suggest that Hezbollah supporters were among those who attacked the convoy, though the group has not officially commented.</p>

<p>UNIFIL, which has been operating in Lebanon since 1978, is tasked with maintaining peace along the country's southern border with Israel. While the force has faced hostility in the past, this attack is particularly alarming due to its location near the capital and the high-ranking officer involved.</p>

<h2>International Condemnation and Calls for Justice</h2>
<p>The attack has been widely condemned. UNIFIL officials have emphasized that targeting peacekeepers could constitute a war crime under international law. The Lebanese army and security forces have launched an investigation, but pressure is mounting for swift action.</p>

<p>Diplomatic figures from the United Nations, the European Union, and several Western governments have urged Lebanese authorities to bring those responsible to justice. The incident raises concerns about the safety of peacekeeping forces in Lebanon and the broader stability of the region.</p>

<h2>What Happens Next?</h2>
<p>With tensions already high, this attack could have serious consequences. If the perpetrators are not held accountable, it may embolden further violence against international forces. At the same time, Lebanon's fragile political situation makes it difficult to predict how authorities will respond.</p>

<p>For now, the world watches as investigations unfold. The safety of peacekeepers, the role of Hezbollah, and Lebanon's internal divisions are all under scrutiny. What happens next could shape the future of UNIFIL's mission-and Lebanon's stability-for years to come.</p>
