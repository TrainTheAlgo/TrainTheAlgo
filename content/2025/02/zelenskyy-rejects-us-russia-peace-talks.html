<h2>Ukraine Stands Firm: Zelenskyy Refuses Peace Talks Excluding His Nation</h2>

<p>Can a war be ended without the participation of the country at its center? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy doesn't think so. His recent rejection of U.S.-Russia peace talks that exclude Ukraine has sent a clear message: no decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine.</p>

<p>The controversy erupted after a phone call between former U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, where they reportedly discussed potential negotiations to end the war. Zelenskyy, blindsided by the conversation, swiftly condemned the idea of peace talks happening without Ukraine's direct involvement. He called such discussions "very dangerous" and warned that any deal made without Kyiv's input could undermine Ukraine's sovereignty and security.</p>

<h2>A Diplomatic Standoff</h2>

<p>Zelenskyy's stance is not just about principle-it's about survival. He has consistently argued that Ukraine must be at the table for any meaningful peace process. His concerns are shared by European leaders and some U.S. officials, who fear that a deal struck between Washington and Moscow without Kyiv could lead to an agreement that benefits Russia at Ukraine's expense.</p>

<p>At the Munich Security Conference, Zelenskyy met with U.S. Vice President JD Vance to reinforce his position. He emphasized that any negotiations must involve Ukraine, the U.S., and European allies working together. His message was clear: Ukraine will not accept a dictated peace.</p>

<h2>The Saudi Arabia Talks and Growing Tensions</h2>

<p>Further complicating matters, U.S. and Russian officials are set to meet in Saudi Arabia to discuss potential peace terms. Zelenskyy has claimed that Ukraine was not invited to these talks, raising concerns about the transparency and legitimacy of the process. The exclusion has only fueled tensions, with Ukrainian officials warning that any agreement reached without their participation would be unacceptable.</p>

<p>For Zelenskyy, the stakes are high. He has repeatedly called for "real security guarantees" before engaging in any peace talks. His government remains wary of ceasefires or agreements that do not ensure Ukraine's long-term security, fearing they could simply give Russia time to regroup and launch further offensives.</p>

<h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>

<p>This diplomatic standoff highlights the broader geopolitical struggle at play. The U.S. and Russia, both eager to shape the outcome of the war, are maneuvering for influence. Meanwhile, Ukraine is fighting to ensure that its future is not decided in backroom deals between global powers.</p>

<p>As the situation unfolds, one thing is certain: Zelenskyy is not backing down. His insistence on Ukraine's direct involvement in peace talks is a bold move, one that could shape the course of the war and the region's future. Whether the U.S. and Russia will heed his demands remains to be seen, but for now, Ukraine is making it clear-it will not be sidelined in decisions about its own fate.</p>
