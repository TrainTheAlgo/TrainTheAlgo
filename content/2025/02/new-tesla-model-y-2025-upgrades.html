<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">A Bold New Look with Smarter Safety</h2>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
Tesla’s best-selling SUV just got a major upgrade. The 2025 Model Y, known as the "Juniper" refresh, introduces a sleeker design, improved aerodynamics, and cutting-edge safety features. But is it worth the hype? Let’s dive into the biggest changes and what they mean for drivers.
</p>

<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">Exterior Upgrades: A More Refined Presence</h2>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
The new Model Y sports a refreshed front and rear design, featuring a more aggressive bumper and a sleek light bar that gives it a futuristic edge. Tesla has also introduced a new Glacier Blue color, adding to its already striking palette. 
</p>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
Beyond aesthetics, the redesign improves aerodynamics by 4%, helping to extend range and efficiency. New wheels and tires, combined with a retuned suspension, promise a smoother and quieter ride.
</p>

<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">Interior: Comfort Meets Technology</h2>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
Step inside, and the changes are immediately noticeable. The dashboard and door panels now feature softer, premium materials, enhancing the cabin’s luxury feel. Tesla has also improved soundproofing with acoustic glazing, reducing cabin noise by 20%.
</p>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
A new 15.4-inch center display offers a more immersive experience, while rear passengers get their own 8-inch touchscreen. Customizable ambient lighting, ventilated front seats, and power-folding rear seats add to the comfort and convenience.
</p>

<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">Safety Innovations: Smarter Protection</h2>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
Tesla has taken safety to the next level with the introduction of a 4D radar imaging system. This advanced technology, set to be activated via a software update in late 2025, allows for dynamic airbag deployment based on passenger size and positioning.
</p>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
Another key addition is the Active Hood, designed to reduce pedestrian impact in case of a collision. The Adaptive Main Beam headlights, similar to those in the Model 3, adjust based on steering angle and speed, improving nighttime visibility.
</p>

<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">Performance and Range: More Miles, Same Battery</h2>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
Despite using the same battery pack, the 2025 Model Y manages to squeeze out more efficiency. The Long Range AWD trim now offers an estimated 320 miles per charge, thanks to improved aerodynamics and software optimizations.
</p>

<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">Pricing and Availability</h2>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
Tesla has launched the new Model Y at $59,990 for the fully loaded "Launch Series," which includes all available upgrades and Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software. Meanwhile, the older Model Y remains on sale at a reduced price, giving buyers a unique choice between the refreshed and previous versions.
</p>

<p class="p-2 my-4">
With its refined design, smarter safety features, and improved efficiency, the 2025 Model Y is more compelling than ever. The question is, will these upgrades be enough to keep it ahead of the competition?
