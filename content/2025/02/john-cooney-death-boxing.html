<p class="p-2 my-4">
John Cooney stepped into the ring on February 1, 2025, ready to defend his Celtic super-featherweight title. The 28-year-old Irish boxer had trained for months, preparing for what was expected to be a tough but fair contest against Welsh fighter Nathan Howells. What no one could have predicted was that this fight would be his last.

The match at Belfast’s Ulster Hall was intense. Cooney fought hard, but by the ninth round, the referee stopped the fight, handing him his first professional defeat. Moments later, it became clear something was terribly wrong. Cooney collapsed, showing signs of severe distress. He was rushed to Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital, where doctors diagnosed an intracranial hemorrhage—a life-threatening brain injury.
