<h2>The Warning America Can't Ignore</h2>
<p>America's tech giants are at risk of losing their global dominance. Lina Khan, former chair of the Federal Trade Commission, has issued a stark warning: monopolistic practices are stifling innovation, leaving the U.S. vulnerable to foreign competition. If the country wants to maintain its technological edge, it must embrace competition, not protect entrenched giants.</p>

<h2>The DeepSeek Wake-Up Call</h2>
<p>When Chinese AI firm DeepSeek unveiled a powerful new model, it sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley. Investors like Marc Andreessen called it "AI's Sputnik moment," a sign that the U.S. was falling behind. But Khan sees it differently. To her, DeepSeek is a warning that America's tech industry has grown complacent, relying on dominance rather than innovation.</p>

<p>For years, companies like Google, Apple, and Amazon have argued that their size and resources are necessary to keep the U.S. ahead in AI. They claim that only massive investment in computing power and data can drive progress. Yet DeepSeek's success suggests otherwise. Despite U.S. firms having access to the world's best talent, capital, and infrastructure, they are being challenged by leaner, more agile competitors.</p>

<h2>How Monopolies Kill Innovation</h2>
<p>Tech giants didn't get to where they are by simply out-innovating their rivals. Many of them maintained dominance by acquiring competitors and building barriers to entry. This strategy has worked well for their bottom lines, but it has come at a cost: a lack of disruptive breakthroughs.</p>

<p>History shows that monopolies rarely drive radical innovation. IBM, AT&T, and Microsoft all faced antitrust scrutiny in the past, and those legal battles paved the way for new players to emerge. The breakup of AT&T in the 1980s, for example, led to a wave of telecommunications advancements. Similarly, Microsoft's antitrust struggles in the 1990s helped create the conditions for Google and other internet companies to thrive.</p>

<p>Today, the same pattern is playing out in AI. Google pioneered the Transformer architecture that underpins modern AI models, but it was startups like OpenAI that turned it into a revolution. Large corporations, focused on protecting their existing businesses, often fail to capitalize on their own innovations.</p>

<h2>The Boeing Lesson</h2>
<p>Khan draws a parallel between today's tech giants and Boeing. Once a symbol of American engineering excellence, Boeing's dominance led to complacency. After merging with McDonnell Douglas in 1997, the company prioritized financial engineering over product innovation. The result? A series of safety failures that tarnished its reputation.</p>

<p>Similarly, if the U.S. government treats tech giants as "national champions" and shields them from competition, it risks creating an industry that is more focused on maintaining power than pushing boundaries. The lesson from Boeing is clear: monopolies don't make industries stronger-they make them weaker.</p>

<h2>What Needs to Change</h2>
<p>Khan argues that the best way to keep America ahead in AI is to foster competition. This means enforcing antitrust laws, preventing dominant firms from acquiring upstart rivals, and ensuring that smaller players have access to the resources they need to compete.</p>

<p>One key step is requiring AI developers to release enough information about their models to allow others to build on their work. If a handful of companies control access to AI technology, they can dictate the pace of progress. But if the market remains open, new players can emerge with fresh ideas and disruptive innovations.</p>

<p>Tech giants will likely push back, arguing that regulation will slow them down. But history suggests the opposite. When markets are open and competitive, innovation flourishes. The U.S. didn't become a tech powerhouse by protecting monopolies-it did so by allowing challengers to rise.</p>

<p>The future of American technology depends on whether policymakers heed Khan's warning. Will they double down on protecting today's giants, or will they create the conditions for the next wave of innovators to thrive?</p>
