<h2>A Deal Without Ukraine? Zelensky Says No</h2>
<p>Volodymyr Zelensky is making one thing clear: Ukraine cannot be sidelined in any negotiations between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. As discussions about a potential peace deal gain traction, the Ukrainian president is pushing back against any arrangement that excludes his country. His message is simple-no deal can be made about Ukraine without Ukraine.</p>

<p>Trump's recent call with Putin, which took place before he spoke with Zelensky, has raised concerns in Kyiv. Zelensky has publicly stated that he found it "not very pleasing" that Trump prioritized Putin in these discussions. His frustration is not just about protocol; it's about security, sovereignty, and the future of Ukraine.</p>

<h2>The Stakes for Ukraine</h2>
<p>For Zelensky, the issue is not just about being included in talks-it's about ensuring that any agreement includes real security guarantees. He has repeatedly warned that a ceasefire alone is not enough. Without concrete measures, Ukraine risks being left vulnerable to future Russian aggression.</p>

<p>At the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky met with U.S. Vice President JD Vance to emphasize the need for a clear strategy to "stop Putin" before engaging in any negotiations. His demands include continued military aid, a pathway to NATO membership, and assurances that Ukraine will not be forced into a deal that weakens its position.</p>

<h2>Trump, Putin, and the Future of NATO</h2>
<p>The broader concern in Europe is how Trump's foreign policy will shape NATO and U.S. commitments in the region. Trump has previously expressed skepticism about NATO's role, and European leaders are watching closely to see how his approach to Russia evolves.</p>

<p>Zelensky's insistence on security guarantees reflects a deep distrust of Putin's intentions. He has suggested that Putin is not genuinely seeking peace but rather looking for ways to weaken Ukraine's position. Without firm commitments from the U.S. and its allies, Ukraine fears being left in a precarious situation.</p>

<h2>A Test for International Diplomacy</h2>
<p>The unfolding situation is a test of how the international community will handle Ukraine's future. Will the U.S. and its allies stand firm in supporting Ukraine, or will they push for a quick resolution that may not fully address Ukraine's security concerns?</p>

<p>Zelensky is not waiting to find out. He is making it clear that Ukraine will not accept any deal that does not include its direct involvement and long-term security. The question now is whether world leaders will listen.</p>
