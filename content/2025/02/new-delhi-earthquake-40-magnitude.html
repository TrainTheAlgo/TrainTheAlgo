<h2>New Delhi Wakes to Tremors</h2>
<p>At 5:36 am IST, a 4.0 magnitude earthquake jolted New Delhi and the surrounding National Capital Region (NCR). The National Center for Seismology pinpointed the epicenter at latitude 28.59 N, longitude 77.16 E, with a shallow depth of just 5 kilometers. Though no immediate damage or casualties were reported, the tremors were strong enough to wake residents and spark a flurry of reactions online.</p>

<h2>How It Felt on the Ground</h2>
<p>For those in Delhi, Noida, and Greater Noida, the quake felt like a sudden jolt, similar to the sensation of a high-speed train passing by. Some reported hearing a low rumble before the shaking began, while others described their beds and furniture vibrating for a few seconds. The brief but noticeable tremor left many startled, with some rushing to check on family members.</p>

<h2>Social Media Erupts</h2>
<p>Within minutes, social media platforms were flooded with posts from residents sharing their experiences. Hashtags like #DelhiEarthquake and #Earthquake trended on X (formerly Twitter), with users posting videos of swaying ceiling fans and rattling windows. News agencies such as ANI and PTI quickly confirmed the event, adding to the growing online conversation.</p>

<p>While social media provides real-time reactions, it is important to verify information from official sources. Some exaggerated claims and misleading posts often surface during such events, making it crucial to rely on seismic authorities for accurate updates.</p>

<h2>Delhi's Seismic Reality</h2>
<p>New Delhi falls in Zone IV of India's seismic map, indicating a high risk for earthquakes. While today's tremor was relatively mild, the region has experienced stronger quakes in the past. Experts warn that preparedness is key, as larger seismic events remain a possibility.</p>

<p>Authorities recommend that residents stay informed about earthquake safety measures, such as securing heavy furniture, identifying safe spots in their homes, and having an emergency plan in place. While today's quake caused no harm, it serves as a reminder of the region's vulnerability to seismic activity.</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>Seismologists will continue monitoring the region for aftershocks or further seismic activity. For now, life in Delhi has returned to normal, but the tremor has left many wondering-how prepared are we for the next big one?</p>
