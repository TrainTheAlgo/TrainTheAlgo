<h2>They'll Never Know ChatGPT Wrote This</h2>
<p>Last week, a client read their AI-generated proposal out loud in a meeting. By the third sentence, everyone knew. The robotic rhythm. The corporate word salad. The inevitable "in conclusion" that made half the room check their phones.</p>

<p>Sound familiar? If you've ever used ChatGPT or any AI writing tool, you've probably seen it too. The writing is technically correct, but it feels... off. Like it was written by someone who's never had a real conversation. That's because it was.</p>

<h2>Why AI Still Sounds Like a Robot</h2>
<p>AI doesn't write like a person. It writes like a committee. It's trained on millions of documents and mimics the average. And average writing? It's awful. Think corporate memos, academic papers, and SEO blogs from 2012.</p>

<p>That's why AI loves phrases like "navigate the landscape" or "embark on a journey." It's not trying to be poetic. It's just regurgitating what it's seen a thousand times. The result? Text that sounds like it was written by a motivational poster with a LinkedIn account.</p>

<h2>The Three Dead Giveaways</h2>
<p>There are a few tells that instantly scream "a robot wrote this." First, the metaphors. No one in real life says "leverage synergies" or "unlock potential." Second, the bullet points. AI loves them. It turns everything into a list, even when it shouldn't. Third, the wrap-up. "In conclusion, we've explored..." No. Just no.</p>

<h2>The Fix: The Humaniser Prompt</h2>
<p>Here's the exact prompt that transforms AI sludge into sharp, human-sounding prose. Copy it. Paste it. Use it every time:</p>

<pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded text-sm overflow-x-auto">
 Rewrite the text below so it reads like one incisive professional talking to another.
- Keep every idea and fact unless changing it makes the point clearer.
- Active voice. Paragraphs no longer than three short sentences.
- Vary sentence length; avoid a metronome rhythm.
- Swap jargon or $10 words for plain ones. Use contractions.
- Delete clichs, filler adverbs, and stock metaphors (navigate, journey, roadmap, etc.).
- No bullet points unless they're essential for scan-ability.
- No summary footer. End on a crisp final line, not a recap.
- Never use em dashes; use commas, periods, or rewrite the sentence instead.
- Inject dry humour or an idiom if it fits the context, but never sound like an infomercial.
- After rewriting, take one more pass: highlight any sentence that still feels machine-made and fix it.
</pre>

<p>Each rule targets a specific AI weakness. Active voice kills the passive drone. Short paragraphs prevent the wall-of-text syndrome. Cutting clichs removes 90% of what makes AI sound fake.</p>

<h2>Your Five-Step Rewrite Sprint</h2>
<p>Here's how to use the prompt in under five minutes:</p>

<p>First, paste your AI draft into ChatGPT. Don't edit it yet. Just drop it in raw. Then, paste the Humaniser Prompt before it and hit enter. Watch the transformation.</p>

<p>Next, read the result out loud. If you stumble, the sentence needs work. Then, add your fingerprint. Replace generic phrases with something specific from your experience. Finally, polish it. Cut anything that makes you cringe. Trust your gut.</p>

<h2>See It In Action</h2>
<p>Here's a before-and-after that shows the power of the prompt:</p>

<p><strong>AI Original (92 words):</strong><br>
"Organizations seeking to leverage artificial intelligence must navigate the complex landscape of implementation challenges. Furthermore, stakeholders should facilitate cross-functional collaboration to ensure optimal outcomes. It is imperative to utilize best practices throughout the journey, maximizing value while minimizing potential risks. In conclusion, successful AI adoption requires a comprehensive approach that addresses both technical and cultural considerations."</p>

<p><strong>Humanised Version (68 words):</strong><br>
"Getting AI to work in your company is harder than the vendors admit. You need people from different departments actually talking to each other, not just sitting in the same room. Focus on what works, not what sounds impressive in a PowerPoint. The tech is the easy part. Getting your team to change how they work? That's where most companies hit the wall."</p>

<p>Notice the difference? The human version sounds like someone explaining it over coffee, not reading from a teleprompter. It's clear, direct, and real.</p>

<h2>Your Human Voice Checklist</h2>
<p>Keep this next to your monitor:</p>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
  <li>Active verbs dominate</li>
  <li>Sentences vary from 5 to 20 words</li>
  <li>Zero clichs or corporate speak</li>
  <li>At least one personal example</li>
  <li>Ends strong, no summary</li>
  <li>Would I say this out loud?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Today's Challenge</h2>
<p>Take your last AI draft. Run it through the Humaniser Prompt. Time yourself. It should take under five minutes. The more you do it, the more natural it becomes. Eventually, you'll start writing better first drafts-even without the prompt.</p>

<p>AI is your assistant, not your ghostwriter. Don't let it flatten your voice. Make it sound like you, only faster.</p>

<p>Because the best writing doesn't sound like it came from a machine. It sounds like it came from someone worth listening to.</p>
