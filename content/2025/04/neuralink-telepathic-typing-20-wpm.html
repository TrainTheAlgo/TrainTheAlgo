<h2>Typing With Your Mind: Neuralink Hits 20 Words Per Minute</h2>
<p>What if you could type just by thinking? Neuralink, Elon Musk's brain-computer interface company, has made that a reality-at least for one person. In a recent demonstration, a participant with ALS used Neuralink's brain implant to type 20 words per minute using only their thoughts. That's not science fiction. It's happening now.</p>

<p>This milestone, announced on April 13, 2025, is more than a technical achievement. It's a glimpse into a future where communication is no longer bound by physical ability. For people with severe motor impairments, this could be life-changing. For the rest of us, it's a preview of how we might one day interact with machines-directly, seamlessly, and silently.</p>

<h2>How It Works: A Coin-Sized Window Into the Brain</h2>
<p>The device itself is about the size of a coin. It's implanted in the motor cortex-the part of the brain that controls movement. Over 1,000 tiny electrodes detect neural activity, specifically the signals associated with imagined hand movements. These signals are then decoded by Neuralink's AI software, which translates them into cursor movements and keystrokes on a screen.</p>

<p>In the latest test, the participant-who is paralyzed due to ALS-was able to type a 100-word paragraph in just over five minutes. That's roughly 20 words per minute, with a 95 percent accuracy rate. For comparison, previous trials hovered around 80 percent accuracy and much slower speeds. This is a significant leap forward.</p>

<h2>Why 20 WPM Matters</h2>
<p>Twenty words per minute might not sound fast. Most people type around 40 to 50 words per minute with their hands. But for someone who can't move or speak, 20 WPM is a revolution. It's fast enough for real-time conversation. It's fast enough to write emails, send texts, and interact with the digital world independently.</p>

<p>Other assistive technologies, like eye-tracking systems, can reach similar or even higher speeds. But they rely on physical movement-eye motion, head tilt, or facial gestures. Neuralink's system bypasses all of that. It reads intent directly from the brain. That opens the door to users who can't control their eyes or muscles at all.</p>

<h2>From Cursor Control to Full Sentences</h2>
<p>Neuralink's earlier trials focused on basic tasks: moving a cursor, clicking icons, selecting letters. This new demonstration shows the system can handle more complex tasks like composing full sentences. That's a big jump in decoding sophistication. It means the AI is getting better at interpreting the brain's electrical signals and turning them into meaningful output.</p>

<p>The company says the implant uses less than 100 milliwatts of power and transmits data wirelessly. That makes it viable for long-term use without frequent recharging. So far, no adverse effects have been reported in the six months since the implant was installed. But long-term safety data is still limited, and larger trials are needed.</p>

<h2>What's Next: Beyond Typing</h2>
<p>Typing is just the beginning. Neuralink envisions a future where users can control smartphones, computers, and even robotic limbs with their thoughts. Imagine adjusting your smart thermostat, sending a message, or playing a video game-all without lifting a finger. The company is also exploring ways to translate thoughts directly into speech, bypassing the need for typing altogether.</p>

<p>Of course, there are concerns. Privacy is a big one. If your brain data is being transmitted wirelessly, who owns it? Who can access it? Neuralink says all data is encrypted and stored locally, but critics argue that more safeguards are needed. There's also the question of consent and data use in future commercial applications.</p>

<h2>Promise and Caution</h2>
<p>Neuralink's achievement is undeniably impressive. It shows that brain-computer interfaces are no longer theoretical. They're real, and they're improving fast. But the technology is still in its early stages. It's invasive, expensive, and not yet widely available. The company estimates it will take at least two more years before the system is ready for commercial use.</p>

<p>Still, the implications are profound. For people with disabilities, this could restore independence. For the tech world, it could redefine how we interact with machines. And for society, it raises new questions about the boundaries between mind and machine.</p>

<p>Typing with your mind used to be a dream. Now it's a benchmark. What comes next may be even harder to imagine-but no less real.</p>
