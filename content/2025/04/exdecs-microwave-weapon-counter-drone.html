<h2>Microwave Weapons vs. Drone Swarms: A New Battlefield</h2>
<p>What if the next major threat to military forces isn't a tank or a missile, but a $500 drone flying in a swarm of hundreds? The U.S. Marine Corps is betting on a new kind of weapon to stop them-one that doesn't fire bullets or lasers, but invisible waves of energy.</p>

<p>Meet ExDECS, short for Expeditionary Directed Energy Counter-Swarm. It's a high-power microwave (HPM) system designed to fry the electronics of multiple drones at once. And it's not science fiction. The Marines are already testing it.</p>

<h2>Why Drone Swarms Are a Growing Threat</h2>
<p>In modern warfare, drones are no longer just tools for surveillance. They're weapons. Cheap, fast, and increasingly autonomous, drones are being used in swarms to overwhelm traditional defenses. Ukraine, for example, reported over 18,000 drone attacks in 2024 alone. Many of these were coordinated, low-cost, and devastating.</p>

<p>Conventional air defense systems-missiles, guns, and even lasers-struggle to keep up. Lasers can only target one drone at a time. Missiles are expensive. And bullets? Not precise enough. That's where microwave weapons come in.</p>

<h2>How ExDECS Works</h2>
<p>ExDECS is built on Epirus' Leonidas platform, a trailer-mounted system that emits a wide beam of microwave energy. When a swarm of drones enters its range, the system sends out a pulse that disrupts their electronics, causing them to crash or lose control. It's like an electromagnetic shotgun blast-fast, wide, and effective.</p>

<p>Unlike jammers, which rely on interfering with radio signals, ExDECS targets the hardware itself. That means it can disable drones even if they're pre-programmed or operating autonomously. And because it doesn't rely on ammunition, it can fire repeatedly at a fraction of the cost of traditional weapons.</p>

<h2>Testing Underway</h2>
<p>In early 2025, the Marine Corps began testing ExDECS at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren, Virginia. The trials are part of the PEGASUS program-short for Preliminary Evaluation of Ground-based Anti-Swarm UAS System. The goal is to see how ExDECS fits into the broader ForceShield air defense network, which includes radars, missiles, and guns.</p>

<p>Mobility is key. ExDECS is designed to be expeditionary, meaning it can be deployed quickly and moved easily. That makes it ideal for forward operating bases or mobile units that need to defend against sudden drone attacks.</p>

<h2>Cost, Capability, and Controversy</h2>
<p>Supporters of HPM systems point to their cost-effectiveness. The British Army's RapidDestroyer, a similar system, reportedly neutralized over 100 drones in a single test at just 13 cents per shot. That's a game-changer in a world where drone attacks are cheap and frequent.</p>

<p>But there are limitations. Some next-generation drones use fiber-optic controls, which are immune to radio-frequency jamming and more resistant to microwave disruption. These drones have already appeared in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, raising concerns about the long-term viability of HPM systems.</p>

<p>Critics also warn against overreliance on emerging tech. While ExDECS is promising, it's not a silver bullet. A layered defense strategy-combining radar, kinetic weapons, and directed energy-is still essential.</p>

<h2>Beyond the Battlefield</h2>
<p>The implications of ExDECS go far beyond military use. As drones become more common in civilian airspace, the need for effective countermeasures grows. Airports, power plants, and public events are all potential targets. A mobile, non-lethal system like ExDECS could offer a scalable solution for homeland security.</p>

<p>Imagine a future where a single truck-mounted system can protect a stadium from a rogue drone swarm. That's not just possible-it's already being tested.</p>

<h2>The Future of Defense is Invisible</h2>
<p>Microwave weapons like ExDECS represent a shift in how we think about defense. They're fast, flexible, and designed for the threats of tomorrow. As the Marine Corps continues its evaluation, the results could shape not just military doctrine, but the future of public safety.</p>

<p>In a world where the next attack could come from the sky in the form of a $200 quadcopter, the most powerful weapon might be the one you can't see.</p>
