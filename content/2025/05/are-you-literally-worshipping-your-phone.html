<h2>The Gospel According to the Algorithm</h2>
<p>Every morning, millions of people wake up and reach for the same object. Not a cup of coffee. Not a book. Their phone. Before brushing teeth, before speaking to another human, we check our notifications. We scroll. We pray to the feed.</p>

<p>This isn't just habit. It's ritual. And it's starting to look a lot like worship.</p>

<h2>When Technology Becomes Theology</h2>
<p>Silicon Valley has long flirted with the divine. Ray Kurzweil, a director at Google, has openly talked about "inventing God" through artificial intelligence. The Church of the Way of the Future, founded by a former Google engineer, literally aims to worship AI. These aren't metaphors. They're mission statements.</p>

<p>But you don't need to be a transhumanist to fall into digital devotion. Most of us already do it-quietly, unconsciously, and every single day.</p>

<h2>The Algorithm Knows All</h2>
<p>We talk about "the algorithm" like it's a sentient being. It "knows" us. It "shows" us what we need. It "blesses" some content and "ignores" others. This language isn't accidental. It mirrors the way people talk about God.</p>

<p>When a video appears on your feed at just the right moment, you might say, "This was meant for me." That's not far from saying, "This was God's plan." The algorithm becomes a kind of digital deity-mysterious, omniscient, and all-powerful.</p>

<h2>Scroll as Sacrament</h2>
<p>Scrolling isn't just a way to pass time. It's a ritual. A repetitive, meditative act that offers comfort, distraction, and sometimes even revelation. Each swipe is a silent prayer: show me something good. Show me something true. Show me something that makes me feel less alone.</p>

<p>Creators participate too. Artists post their work with captions like "until it reaches the right person." That's not marketing. That's faith. Faith that the algorithm will deliver their message to the chosen one.</p>

<h2>Digital Communion</h2>
<p>French sociologist mile Durkheim coined the term "collective effervescence" to describe the emotional high people feel when participating in shared rituals. Think of a church choir, a protest, or a football match. Now think of a viral TikTok trend.</p>

<p>When you join a meme, duet a video, or comment "I feel seen," you're not just engaging-you're communing. You're part of something bigger. And that feeling of belonging? That's the hook. That's what keeps us coming back.</p>

<h2>The Sacred and the Profane</h2>
<p>Durkheim also said that rituals create sacred symbols-objects or ideas that feel special, set apart from the ordinary. Online, these are the trending audios, the viral dances, the inside jokes. If you don't know them, you're out of the loop. You're spiritually disconnected.</p>

<p>"You haven't seen that meme?" someone asks, incredulous. It's not just a question. It's a judgment. A reminder that you're not part of the faith. Not yet.</p>

<h2>Why It Feels So Good</h2>
<p>There's nothing inherently wrong with this. Rituals are human. They help us make sense of the world. They give us structure, meaning, and connection. Social media does the same. It's fun. It's powerful. It's addictive.</p>

<p>The danger isn't in the ritual. It's in forgetting that it is a ritual. When we stop questioning the algorithm, when we accept its decisions as fate, we surrender our agency. We stop being users and start being disciples.</p>

<h2>Reclaiming the Scroll</h2>
<p>So what can we do? Start by noticing. Pay attention to the language you use. Catch yourself when you say "the algorithm wants this" or "this video found me." Ask: is this belief, or is it programming?</p>

<p>Next, disrupt the ritual. Leave your phone in another room. Scroll with intention, not compulsion. Follow creators who challenge you, not just those who comfort you. And most importantly, remember that the algorithm isn't a god. It's a tool. A very powerful, very persuasive tool-but still just a tool.</p>

<p>We built it. We can unbuild it. Or at least, we can stop bowing to it.</p>

<p>Because the moment you stop questioning the feed is the moment the feed starts defining you.</p>
