<h2>Your Venmo Transactions Are Public-Here's How to Fix That</h2>
<p>Imagine a stranger knowing who you pay, when you pay them, and even the reason for the payment. That's not a hypothetical scenario-it's happening right now to millions of Venmo users. By default, Venmo makes your transactions public, exposing your financial activity to anyone who cares to look.</p>

<p>Scammers, stalkers, and data brokers are taking advantage of this. They use Venmo's public feed to track relationships, impersonate friends, and even build detailed profiles of users for targeted scams. If you've never checked your Venmo privacy settings, your payment history is likely visible to the world.</p>

<p>But you can fix this in under a minute. Here are three critical settings you need to change right now to protect your privacy.</p>

<h2>1. Make Your Transactions Private</h2>
<p>By default, every payment you make on Venmo is public. That means anyone can see who you're paying and why. To change this:</p>

<p>1. Open the Venmo app and tap the <strong>Settings</strong> icon () in the top right.</p>
<p>2. Select <strong>Privacy</strong> and set your <strong>Default Privacy Settings</strong> to <strong>Private</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Bonus: Tap <strong>Past Transactions</strong> and select <strong>Change All to Private</strong> to hide previous payments.</p>

<p>Why this matters: This prevents strangers from seeing your financial activity, reducing the risk of scams and unwanted attention.</p>

<h2>2. Hide Your Friends List</h2>
<p>Most people don't realize that Venmo exposes their full friends list by default. This means anyone can see who you interact with, making it easy for scammers to impersonate people you trust.</p>

<p>To disable this:</p>

<p>1. Go to <strong>Settings</strong>  <strong>Privacy</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Scroll to <strong>Friends List</strong> and change it to <strong>Only Me</strong>.</p>

<p>Why this matters: Fraudsters use your friends list to send fake payment requests, pretending to be someone you know.</p>

<h2>3. Remove Yourself from Public Search</h2>
<p>Even if your transactions are private, your Venmo account is still searchable by name or phone number. This makes it easy for strangers to find and track you.</p>

<p>To hide your account:</p>

<p>1. Go to <strong>Settings</strong>  <strong>Privacy</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Toggle off <strong>"Appear in other users' friend lists"</strong>.</p>

<p>Why this matters: This prevents random people from finding your Venmo profile and linking it to your other online accounts.</p>

<h2>Bonus Tip: Stop Venmo from Accessing Your Contacts</h2>
<p>Venmo automatically scans your phone contacts to suggest friends. While this might seem convenient, it also means your financial connections are being tracked.</p>

<p>To disable this:</p>

<p><strong>On iPhone:</strong></p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Settings</strong>  Scroll down and tap <strong>Venmo</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Toggle off <strong>Find Contacts</strong>, <strong>Location</strong>, <strong>Bluetooth</strong>, and <strong>Background App Refresh</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>On Android:</strong></p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Settings</strong>  Tap <strong>Apps</strong>  Find <strong>Venmo</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Tap <strong>Permissions</strong>  Select <strong>Contacts</strong>  Choose <strong>Deny</strong>.</p>

<p>Why this matters: This prevents Venmo from automatically adding your contacts as friends and reduces unnecessary data collection.</p>

<h2>Venmo Isn't the Only Risk-What About Your Other Payment Apps?</h2>
<p>Locking down Venmo is a great start, but it's not the only app exposing your financial data. Cash App, PayPal, and Zelle all have hidden settings that could be putting your privacy at risk.</p>

<p>Beyond payment apps, data brokers are constantly collecting and selling your personal information. Your name, phone number, and even past purchases are sitting in databases, waiting to be exploited.</p>

<p>Most people assume they're safe-until they become a target. The best time to secure your digital life is before something goes wrong.</p>

<p>Take a few minutes today to adjust your settings. Your future self will thank you.</p>
