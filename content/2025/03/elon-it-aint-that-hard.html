<h2>Government Tech is Broken-But Fixing It Doesn't Have to Be</h2>
<p>Elon Musk recently pointed out what many have known for years: government computer systems are a tangled mess. They don't communicate, they're outdated, and upgrading them seems like an impossible task. But what if there was a way to fix them in just 90 days-without billion-dollar budgets or massive data centers?</p>

<p>That's exactly what Fractal Computing has been doing. While Musk and his team wrestle with conventional technology, a new approach is already proving that government systems can be rebuilt faster, cheaper, and more efficiently than ever before.</p>

<h2>The Problem: A Digital Dinosaur</h2>
<p>Government systems are notorious for their inefficiency. Medicaid databases don't talk to tax systems. Voter rolls are a mess. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) system, which processes campaign finance data, struggles to handle 500,000 transactions a month. It requires an entire data center, a cloud infrastructure, and a five-figure monthly electricity bill just to stay operational.</p>

<p>Elon isn't wrong-fixing these systems with traditional methods would take years and cost billions. But that's only if you stick to conventional technology.</p>

<h2>The Solution: Fractal Computing</h2>
<p>Fractal Computing takes a radically different approach. Instead of trying to patch up old systems, it builds a digital twin-a parallel system that can run alongside the existing one. This new system is not only faster but also eliminates the need for expensive data centers.</p>

<p>Take the FEC system, for example. Fractal Computing rebuilt it in just three days. The new system can handle a billion transactions a day, runs on a computer the size of a coffee mug, and consumes less power than a table lamp. No data center required.</p>

<h2>90 Days to a Fully Functional System</h2>
<p>Any government system, no matter how large or complex, can be recreated in 90 days or less. The new system runs 1,000 to a million times faster than the legacy version. It consumes so little power that it doesn't need a dedicated data center. And because it operates as a digital twin, it can run alongside the old system indefinitely, verifying every transaction in real time.</p>

<p>When the government is ready, they can simply switch off the old system-eliminating the need for expensive software licenses, massive IT teams, and energy-hungry data centers.</p>

<h2>Voter Rolls on a $7,000 Computer</h2>
<p>Fractal Computing has already moved the voter rolls of 20 states-each of which previously required a massive data center-to a single computer costing less than $7,000. The system processes 200 million transactions per second and can be accessed instantly from a smartphone.</p>

<p>Imagine the cost savings. No more sprawling data centers. No more bloated IT budgets. Just a streamlined, efficient system that works.</p>

<h2>Why Hasn't Elon Called?</h2>
<p>Every week, people ask why Fractal Computing hasn't reached out to Musk. The truth? He already knows. Dozens of people have spoken to him about what Fractal can do. He hasn't called-not because he doubts it works, but because he knows it does.</p>

<p>Elon Musk is a visionary, but when it comes to government tech, he's still thinking in conventional terms. The future isn't about fixing broken systems with outdated methods. It's about replacing them entirely with something better.</p>

<p>And that future is already here.</p>
