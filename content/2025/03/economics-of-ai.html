<h2>The AI Boom Is Real-But Where Are the Economic Gains?</h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence is everywhere. It writes code, answers customer service calls, and even drafts legal documents. But if AI is so powerful, why hasn't it shown up in the productivity numbers yet?</p>

<p>That's the puzzle economists like Erik Brynjolfsson are trying to solve. And the answer, it turns out, is more complicated-and more hopeful-than you might think.</p>

<h2>Productivity: The Missing Miracle?</h2>
<p>AI is already boosting productivity in specific sectors. In call centers, software development, and sales, companies are reporting gains of 20 to 50 percent. But these improvements haven't yet translated into a broad economic boom.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time we've seen this pattern. In the 1980s, economist Robert Solow famously quipped, "You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics." It wasn't until the late 1990s that the IT revolution finally showed up in the numbers. The same may be true for AI.</p>

<p>Why the delay? Because technology alone doesn't drive growth. It's how we use it. Businesses need time to reorganize, retrain workers, and rethink how they operate. That transformation is underway-but it's not instant.</p>

<h2>The J-Curve of Innovation</h2>
<p>Brynjolfsson and his colleagues call this the "Productivity J-Curve." At first, productivity may dip as companies invest in new systems and training. Only later do the gains emerge, often dramatically. It's like planting seeds: the work comes first, the harvest later.</p>

<p>AI is a general-purpose technology, like electricity or the steam engine. These kinds of innovations don't just improve one task-they change everything. But they also require a complete rethinking of how work is done. That takes time, and it's why the biggest economic benefits of AI may still be ahead of us.</p>

<h2>Measuring the Invisible</h2>
<p>Another reason AI's impact is hard to see? We're not measuring it properly. Traditional metrics like GDP miss much of the value created by digital goods and services. If you use Google Maps, ChatGPT, or Spotify, you're getting real value-but it doesn't show up in economic statistics because you're not paying for it.</p>

<p>To fix this, Brynjolfsson's team at Stanford developed a new metric called GDP-B, which tries to capture the consumer benefits of free digital services. Their research suggests that we're underestimating the true value of the digital economy by trillions of dollars.</p>

<h2>Winners, Losers, and the Future of Work</h2>
<p>Even if AI boosts productivity, it raises a deeper question: who benefits? Most people earn their income from work. If machines can do more of that work, what happens to wages, jobs, and inequality?</p>

<p>Without intervention, the gains from AI could concentrate in the hands of a few. That's already happening. The companies building AI-like OpenAI, Google, and Nvidia-are seeing massive valuations. But the average worker isn't necessarily better off.</p>

<p>To avoid a future of extreme inequality, we'll need new policies. That could mean investing in education and retraining, rethinking tax systems, or even exploring ideas like universal basic income. The goal isn't just growth-it's shared prosperity.</p>

<h2>AI as an Economic Equalizer?</h2>
<p>Interestingly, digital goods may help reduce inequality. Brynjolfsson's research shows that free digital services provide more relative value to lower-income users. A billionaire and a student both get the same Wikipedia. In that sense, the digital economy can be a great equalizer-if everyone has access.</p>

<p>But access isn't guaranteed. The benefits of AI depend on infrastructure, education, and digital literacy. Ensuring that everyone can participate in the AI economy is a challenge we can't afford to ignore.</p>

<h2>Betting on the Future</h2>
<p>Brynjolfsson is optimistic. He's even made a bet with fellow economist Robert Gordon that productivity growth will exceed expectations in the 2020s. And he's not just betting-he's working to make it happen, helping companies adopt AI in ways that boost productivity and benefit workers.</p>

<p>We've seen this movie before. The internet, electricity, and the steam engine all took time to reshape the economy. AI is no different. The transformation is coming-but only if we build the systems, skills, and policies to support it.</p>

<p>In the end, the economics of AI isn't just about machines. It's about us-how we adapt, how we share the gains, and how we shape the future we want to live in.</p>

<p>And maybe, just maybe, the real revolution isn't in what AI can do-but in what we choose to do with it.</p>
