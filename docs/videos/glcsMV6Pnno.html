    <title>The Dark Side of AI | The Real Danger That Turning It Off Doesn't Fix</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Artificial Intelligence is transforming the world, but not without significant risks. In this video, we dive into three critical areas of concern as AI accelerates into the future:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Consolidation of Power Through Defense: How autonomous military systems, AI-powered drones, and robot armies could reshape global geopolitics and concentrate power in the hands of superpowers. What happens when war has no human cost?

2Ô∏è‚É£ The Economic Impact of AI Automation: From driverless taxis to AI-powered developers, automation threatens millions of jobs. Can society adapt fast enough, or are we heading toward unprecedented wealth inequality?

3Ô∏è‚É£ AI Cyber Threats and the Stuxnet Legacy: The chilling story of Stuxnet, the first cyberweapon to cause physical damage, and the potential for future AI-powered systems to go rogue, evolving into uncontrollable threats.

As AI develops toward AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence), the risks grow exponentially. Will AI remain aligned with human values, or could it pose an existential threat?

Join us as we explore these urgent questions, the opportunities AI presents, and the challenges we must confront.
