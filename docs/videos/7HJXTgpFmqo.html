    <title>Why You Shouldn't Teach Your Kids To Code</title>
    <meta name="description" content="For years, coding has been seen as a valuable skill, one that opened doors to financial freedom, business opportunities, and creative expression. But in the age of AI, that may no longer be the case.

💡 When ChatGPT launched, it changed how developers build, debug, and manage software. AI-powered tools like Copilot can write entire programs, refactor legacy systems, and even debug code faster than human engineers. If AI is making coding easier, cheaper, and faster—what does that mean for the next generation of developers?

🔍 In this video, I break down:
✅ How AI is disrupting the software development industry
✅ Why the demand for human programmers will decline over the next 30 years
✅ The real skills that will be valuable in the AI era
✅ How to future-proof your kids (and yourself) against automation

The world is shifting from writing code to writing prompts, from programming to directing AI. Should we still be pushing kids to learn something AI can do in seconds? Let's talk about it. 👇 Drop your thoughts in the comments!
