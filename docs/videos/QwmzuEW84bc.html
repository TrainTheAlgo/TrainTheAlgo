    <title>New Jersey Drones Mystery | Why They Don't Want You To Know</title>
    <meta name="description" content="What is going on in the skies over New Jersey and the rest of the world? Mysterious drones, some the size of SUVs, have been spotted for weeks, darting through the night in intricate, coordinated patterns. Residents are baffled, lawmakers are frustrated, and officials?

Well, they’re saying, “We don’t know what this is, but don’t worry about it.”
The Pentagon released a statement saying they don’t believe it’s foreign adversaries while at the same time denying it's the US military… which doesn’t leave a lot of options.

But should we be concerned? Today, we dive deep into what is either a massive global coordinated drone operation or the biggest UAP event in our history.

Let’s break down what we know, what we don’t, and why you’re going to want to research this story for yourself.
