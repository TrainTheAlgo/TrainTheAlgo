    <title>Make Crypto Great Again | Trump Launches $TRUMP Memecoin Token</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Donald Trump just dropped his very own memecoin, $TRUMP, on the Solana blockchainâ€”just days before his second inauguration. ðŸš€  

With an initial price of $10, the coin skyrocketed to $70 within 24 hours, pushing its fully diluted valuation to a jaw-dropping $58 billion. Insiders, including the Trump family, reportedly own 80% of the supply, sparking ethical debates and accusations of blending politics with personal gain.  

Critics are calling it a cash grab, while supporters see it as a bold step toward mainstream crypto adoption. And letâ€™s not forget the dramaâ€”Melania launched her own memecoin, and Eric is diving into DeFi.  

In this video, weâ€™ll break down the launch, the controversies, and what this means for crypto and politics. Is this the future of digital assets or just another speculative frenzy?
