    <title>DeepSeek vs ChatGPT | How Bad Is It For OpenAI and Nvidia?</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Dive into the world of AI training with this deep comparison between DeepSeek R1 and ChatGPT. We unravel the unique approaches each model takes, from training methodologies to real-world performance metrics.

What You'll Learn:
How ChatGPT is trained with pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning.
DeepSeek R1's innovative approach using Group Relative Policy Optimization.
The significance of the Chain of Thought process in both models.
Cost implications of running these models, including the surprising efficiency of DeepSeek R1.
Benchmark comparisons where DeepSeek R1 excels, particularly in reasoning tasks.
