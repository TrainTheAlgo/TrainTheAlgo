<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">Sri Lanka Plunged Into Darkness</h2>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
Millions of Sri Lankans were left without electricity as a massive power outage swept across multiple regions. Businesses shut down, traffic lights failed, and households were plunged into darkness. The blackout, one of the worst in recent years, has raised serious concerns about the stability of the country's power grid.
</p>

<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">What Caused the Blackout?</h2>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
Authorities have pointed to a failure in the national power grid as the primary cause. Initial reports suggest that a technical fault at a major power station triggered a cascading failure, leading to widespread outages. Some experts believe aging infrastructure and inadequate maintenance may have played a role in the collapse.
</p>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
Sri Lanka's power sector has been under strain for years, with frequent breakdowns and supply shortages. The country relies heavily on hydroelectric power, but recent dry weather conditions have reduced water levels in reservoirs, limiting electricity generation. Additionally, fuel shortages have hampered thermal power plants, further exacerbating the crisis.
</p>

<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">Which Areas Are Affected?</h2>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
The blackout has impacted major cities, including Colombo, Kandy, and Galle, as well as rural areas. Reports indicate that some regions have experienced intermittent power cuts, while others have been without electricity for hours. Essential services, including hospitals and emergency response units, have been forced to rely on backup generators.
</p>

<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">How Are People Coping?</h2>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
For many Sri Lankans, power outages are nothing new. However, the scale of this blackout has caused widespread frustration. Businesses have suffered losses, students have struggled with online learning disruptions, and daily life has been thrown into chaos. Social media has been flooded with complaints, with many calling for urgent government action.
</p>

<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">Government Response and Next Steps</h2>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
The government has assured the public that efforts are underway to restore power as quickly as possible. Engineers are working to identify and fix the fault, while emergency measures are being implemented to stabilize the grid. Officials have also hinted at long-term reforms to improve the reliability of the power supply.
</p>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
However, critics argue that these promises have been made before, with little action taken. Many are demanding greater investment in renewable energy and better management of existing resources to prevent future crises.
</p>

<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">Could This Happen Again?</h2>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
Unfortunately, unless significant changes are made, Sri Lanka could face more blackouts in the future. The country's energy infrastructure is aging, and demand for electricity continues to rise. Without proper investment and planning, power failures may become more frequent and severe.
</p>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
For now, Sri Lankans are left waiting in the dark, hoping for a solution that lasts longer than just a temporary fix.
