<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">A Fight That Ended in Tragedy</h2>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
John Cooney stepped into the ring on February 1, 2025, ready to defend his Celtic super-featherweight title. The 28-year-old Irish boxer had trained for months, preparing for what was expected to be a tough but fair contest against Welsh fighter Nathan Howells. What no one could have predicted was that this fight would be his last.
</p>

<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">The Fatal Blow</h2>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
The match at Belfast’s Ulster Hall was intense. Cooney fought hard, but by the ninth round, the referee stopped the fight, handing him his first professional defeat. Moments later, it became clear something was terribly wrong. Cooney collapsed, showing signs of severe distress. He was rushed to Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital, where doctors diagnosed an intracranial hemorrhage—a life-threatening brain injury.
</p>

<p class="p-2 my-4">
Emergency surgery was performed, and for a week, his family, friends, and fans clung to hope. Messages of support flooded in from across the boxing world. Conor McGregor, Barry McGuigan, and other high-profile figures voiced their prayers and support. But on February 8, 2025, the heartbreaking news came—John Cooney had passed away.
</p>

<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">A Sport in Mourning</h2>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
The boxing community was devastated. Promoter Mark Dunlop, who had guided Cooney’s career, shared an emotional statement, calling him a warrior in the ring and a gentleman outside of it. Fans and fellow fighters paid tribute, remembering him not just for his skill but for his kindness and dedication to the sport.
</p>

<p class="p-2 my-4">
A fundraiser initially set up to support his recovery quickly shifted focus to helping his grieving family. Donations poured in, surpassing expectations, a testament to how deeply Cooney had touched people’s lives.
</p>

<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">The Safety Debate</h2>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
Cooney’s death has reignited discussions about safety in boxing. Could the fight have been stopped earlier? Were there warning signs that were missed? Boxing has always been a dangerous sport, but tragedies like this force the industry to reflect. Some argue for stricter medical protocols, while others believe the inherent risks are simply part of the sport.
</p>

<p class="p-2 my-4">
This isn’t the first time boxing has faced such a loss, and it likely won’t be the last. But every tragedy brings renewed calls for change. Whether those calls will lead to action remains to be seen.
</p>

<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">A Legacy That Lives On</h2>
<p class="p-2 my-4">
John Cooney’s career was cut short, but his impact will not be forgotten. He was a fighter in every sense of the word—determined, disciplined, and passionate. His story is a painful reminder of the risks athletes take in pursuit of greatness.
</p>

<p class="p-2 my-4">
As his family, friends, and fans mourn, one thing is certain: John Cooney’s name will be remembered, not just for how he fought, but for the heart he showed both inside and outside the ring.
